# 🧠 WellNet — Medical AI Chatbot using Llama-2

A powerful **medical AI chatbot** built using the **Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML language model** and medical knowledge from *The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine*.  
This system combines **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with **vector search, embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to answer medical questions accurately.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This tool is for informational purposes only and is **NOT** a substitute for professional medical advice.

## 🔍 Project Overview

WellNet is an **AI-powered medical assistant** designed to:
- Understand natural language
- Search a trusted medical knowledge base
- Generate accurate, contextual responses

The system uses:
- **LLaMA-2** for reasoning and text generation  
- **Sentence Transformers** for embeddings  
- **LangChain** for LLM orchestration  
- **Vector databases (Pinecone / FAISS)** for fast similarity search  
- **Flask + Bootstrap** for a clean web interface  

The chatbot runs fully on **CPU** — no GPU required — making it accessible on normal laptops.
